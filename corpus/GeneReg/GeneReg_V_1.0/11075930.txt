Characterization and expression of the arginine biosynthesis gene cluster of Streptomyces clavuligerus. A cluster of genes argCJBDRGH containing most of the arginine biosynthesis genes has been found in Streptomyces clavuligerus after sequencing a 8.3 kb DNA region containing overlapping sequences of two DNA fragments known to contain arginine biosynthesis genes. Subcloning, complementation of E. coli arginine auxotrophic strains and enzymatic assays confirmed the identity of each gene. S1 nuclease mapping studies and Northern hybridization analysis revealed the formation of two large transcripts corresponding to argCJBDR and argGH. The amount of each of these mRNAs is 10 to 44 times higher in a S. clavuligerus argR-disrupted mutant than in the wild type confirming the existence of an ArgR-mediated control of arginine biosynthesis gene expression. A low level constitutive monocistronic transcript of argR was observed in S. clavuligerus cells. Most of the argGH transcript initiating at an adenine 29 nt upstream of the argG initiation codon appears to stop at a termination stem and loop structure present downstream of the argG gene.
