Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase is involved in lambda inhibition of host protein synthesis. Escherichia coli rap mutants do not support vegetative growth of bacteriophage lambda and die upon transcription of lambda DNA bar sites. Bacteria harbouring a pth(ts) mutation synthesize thermosensitive peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) and die at 42 degrees C from a defect in protein synthesis. We present evidence that both rap and pth(ts) mutations affect the same gene: (i) peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity was found to be defective in rap mutants; (ii) at a threshold temperature, pth cells, like rap mutants, prevented lambda growth and were killed by transcription of cloned bar sites; (iii) sequencing a 1600 bp DNA fragment comprising both loci revealed an ORF located within the limits set by a complementation analysis and encoding a putative polypeptide of 21 kDa; (iv) cloning and sequencing of rap and pth(ts) mutant DNAs both revealed single nucleotide transitions from the wild type ORF sequence, resulting in Arg134 to His and Gly101 to Asp changes respectively. Analysis of plasmid-directed proteins identified a polypeptide of approximately 21 kDa; the N-terminal sequence, amino acid composition and isoelectric point of this protein match those expected from the ORF nucleotide sequence. We propose that Pth activity, directly or indirectly, is the target for lambda bar RNA leading to rap cell death.
