Role of MetR and PurR in the activation of glyA by CsgD in Escherichia coli K-12. The csgD gene of Escherichia coli is required for the expression of curli fibres, surface fibres that are important for biofilm formation and infection. Previously, we demonstrated that expression of CsgD from a multicopy plasmid increased expression of the glyA gene, which codes for serine hydroxymethyltransferase. We show here that this activation requires the participation of both known regulatory proteins, MetR and PurR. The adjacent divergently transcribed gene hmp was weakly induced by CsgD, but its induction did not require MetR or PurR. The effect of CsgD on the expression of several pur and met genes was also tested.
