Exonuclease X of Escherichia coli. A novel 3'-5' DNase and Dnaq superfamily member involved in DNA repair. DNA exonucleases are critical for DNA replication, repair, and recombination. In the bacterium Escherichia coli there are 14 DNA exonucleases including exonucleases I-IX (including the two DNA polymerase I exonucleases), RecJ exonuclease, SbcCD exonuclease, RNase T, and the exonuclease domains of DNA polymerase II and III. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a new E. coli exonuclease, exonuclease X. Exonuclease X is a member of a superfamily of proteins that have homology to the 3'-5' exonuclease proofreading subunit (DnaQ) of E. coli DNA polymerase III. We have engineered and purified a (His)(6)-exonuclease X fusion protein and characterized its activity. Exonuclease X is a potent distributive exonuclease, capable of degrading both single-stranded and duplex DNA with 3'-5' polarity. Its high affinity for single-strand DNA and its rapid catalytic rate are similar to the processive exonucleases RecJ and exonuclease I. Deletion of the exoX gene exacerbated the UV sensitivity of a strain lacking RecJ, exonuclease I, and exonuclease VII. When overexpressed, exonuclease X is capable of substituting for exonuclease I in UV repair. As we have proposed for the other single-strand DNA exonucleases, exonuclease X may facilitate recombinational repair by pre-synaptic and/or post-synaptic DNA degradation.
