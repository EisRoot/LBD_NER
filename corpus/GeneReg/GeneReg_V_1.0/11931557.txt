Control of FNR function of Escherichia coli by O2 and reducing conditions. The synthesis of the enzymes constituting the electron transport chain of Escherichia coli is controlled by electron acceptors in order to achieve high ATP yields and high metabolic rates as well. High ATP yields (or efficiency) are obtained by the use of electron acceptors for respiration which allow high ATP yields, preferentially O2, and nitrate in the absence of O2. The rate of metabolism is adjusted by use of respiratory isoenzymes which differ in the rate and the efficiency of energy conservation, such as the non-coupling NADH dehydrogenase II (ndh gene) and the coupling NADH dehydrogenase I (nuo genes). By combination of the contrary principles (rate versus efficiency), growth is optimized for growth yields and rates. One of the major transcriptional regulators controlling the switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration is FNR (fumarate nitrate reductase regulator). FNR is located in the cytoplasm and contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster in the active (anaerobic) state. By reaction with O2 the cluster is converted to a [2Fe-2S] cluster and finally to apoFNR. O2 diffuses into the cytoplasm even at very low O2-tensions (1 microM) where it inactivates [4Fe-4S] x FNR. The formation of [4Fe-4S] x FNR from apoFNR can use glutathione as a reducing agent in vitro. This process could also be important for the reductive activation of FNR in vivo. A model for the control of the functional state of FNR by O2 and glutathione is discussed. According to this model the functional state of FNR is determined by a (rapid) inactivation of FNR by O2, and a slow (constant) reactivation with glutathione as the reducing agent.
