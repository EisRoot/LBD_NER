The cyclic AMP receptor protein is dependent on GcvA for regulation of the gcv operon. The Escherichia coli gcv operon is transcriptionally regulated by the GcvA, GcvR, Lrp, and PurR proteins. In this study, the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) is shown to be involved in positive regulation of the gcv operon. A crp deletion reduced expression of a gcvT-lacZ fusion almost fourfold in glucose minimal (GM) medium. The phenotype was complemented by both the wild-type crp gene and four crp alleles that encode proteins with amino acid substitutions in known activating regions of CRP. A cyaA deletion also resulted in a fourfold decrease in gcvT-lacZ expression, and wild-type expression was restored by the addition of cAMP to the growth medium. A cyaA crp double deletion resulted in levels of gcvT-lacZ expression identical to those observed with either single mutation, showing that CRP and cAMP regulate through the same mechanism. Growth in GM medium plus cAMP or glycerol minimal medium did not result in a significant increase in gcvT-lacZ expression. Thus, the level of cAMP present in GM medium appears to be sufficient for regulation by CRP. DNase I footprint analysis showed that CRP binds and protects two sites centered at bp -313 (site 1) and bp -140 (site 2) relative to the transcription initiation site, but a mutational analysis demonstrated that only site 1 is required for CRP-mediated regulation of gcvT-lacZ expression. Expression of the gcvT-lacZ fusion in a crp gcvA double mutant suggested that CRP's role is dependent on the GcvA protein.
