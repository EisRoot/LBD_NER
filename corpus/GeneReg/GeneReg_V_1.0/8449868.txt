Escherichia coli ferredoxin NADP+ reductase: activation of E. coli anaerobic ribonucleotide reduction, cloning of the gene (fpr), and overexpression of the protein. A specific ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase is induced in anaerobic Escherichia coli. This enzyme, as isolated, lacks activity in the test tube and can be activated anaerobically with S-adenosylmethionine, NADPH, and two previously uncharacterized E. coli fractions. The gene for one of these, previously named dA1, was cloned and sequenced. We found an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 248 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of 27,645 and with an N-terminal segment identical to that determined by direct Edman degradation. In a Kohara library, the gene hybridized between positions 3590 and 3600 on the physical map of E. coli. The deduced amino acid sequence shows a high extent of sequence identity with that of various ferredoxin (flavodoxin) NADP+ reductases. We therefore conclude that dA1 is identical with E. coli ferredoxin (flavodoxin) NADP+ reductase. Biochemical evidence from a bacterial strain, now constructed and overproducing dA1 activity up to 100-fold, strongly supports this conclusion. The sequence of the gene shows an apparent overlap with the reported sequence of mvrA, previously suggested to be involved in the protection against superoxide (M. Morimyo, J. Bacteriol. 170:2136-2142, 1988). We suggest that a frameshift introduced during isolation or sequencing of mvrA caused an error in the determination of its sequence.
