The pdhR-aceEF-lpd operon of Escherichia coli expresses the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Transcript mapping and studies with lacZ translational fusions have shown that the pdhR gene (formerly genA) is the proximal gene of the pdhR-aceE-aceF-lpd operon encoding the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex of Escherichia coli. A pdhR-lpd read-through transcript (7.4 kb) initiating at the pyruvate-inducible pdh promoter, and a smaller lpd transcript (1.7 kb) initiating at the independent lpd promoter, were identified. Evidence showing that the pdhR gene product negatively regulates the synthesis of the PdhR protein and the PDH complex via the pdh promoter was obtained, with pyruvate (or a derivative) serving as the putative inducing coeffector. The partially purified PdhR protein was also found to specifically retard and protect DNA fragments containing the pdh promoter region. The pdh promoter was not strongly controlled by ArcA, FNR or CRP.
