Molecular characterization of adiY, a regulatory gene which affects expression of the biodegradative acid-induced arginine decarboxylase gene (adiA) of Escherichia coli. A transcriptional regulator gene, designated adiY, was found downstream of the biodegradative arginine decarboxylase (adiA) gene (previously known as adi) of Escherichia coli. The arginine decarboxylase system is maximally induced under conditions of acidic pH, anaerobiosis and rich medium, and AdiY was found to increase the expression of adiA. The DNA sequence of adiY encodes a protein of 253 amino acids. Primer extension analysis defined the promoter. The amino acid sequence of AdiY showed homology to the XylS/AraC family of transcriptional regulators, which includes EnvY and AppY. Studies suggested that sequences required for acid induction were also necessary to observe the stimulation by AdiY. An examination of the substitution of AdiY, AppY and EnvY showed that these three proteins can, to some extent, stimulate the other systems.
