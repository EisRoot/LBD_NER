Novel transcriptional control of the pyruvate formate-lyase gene: upstream regulatory sequences and multiple promoters regulate anaerobic expression. The sequence of the 5' regulatory region of the gene encoding pyruvate formate-lyase is presented together with a detailed analysis of the transcriptional signals required for its expression. The sequence data revealed that a gene coding for an open reading frame (orf) of unknown function is situated just upstream of the pfl gene. Analysis of RNA transcripts by Northern blot hybridization demonstrated that the genes for orf and pfl were cotranscribed as an operon but that the pfl gene was also transcribed alone. S1 nuclease protection analysis, primer extension, and construction of lacZ fusions with sequential deletions in the pfl 5' regulatory sequence revealed that transcription initiated from at least six promoters which spanned 1.2 kilobases of DNA. Three of these lay within the orf structural gene and were responsible for the high expression of pfl. All transcripts originating from these promoters terminated in the 3' untranslated region of the pfl gene at a strong rho-independent transcription terminator. All of the promoters were coordinately regulated by anaerobiosis, pyruvate, nitrate, and the fnr gene product, and the sequences thought to be responsible for this regulation lay 0.8 to 1.3 kilobases upstream of the translational initiation codon of the pfl gene. There were two sequences within this region which showed strong homology with that proposed to be required for recognition by the Fnr protein.
