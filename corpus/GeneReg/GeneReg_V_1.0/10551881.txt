Twelve species of the nucleoid-associated protein from Escherichia coli. Sequence recognition specificity and DNA binding affinity. The genome of Escherichia coli is composed of a single molecule of circular DNA with the length of about 47,000 kilobase pairs, which is associated with about 10 major DNA-binding proteins, altogether forming the nucleoid. We expressed and purified 12 species of the DNA-binding protein, i.e. CbpA (curved DNA-binding protein A), CbpB or Rob (curved DNA-binding protein B or right arm of the replication origin binding protein), DnaA (DNA-binding protein A), Dps (DNA-binding protein from starved cells), Fis (factor for inversion stimulation), Hfq (host factor for phage Q(beta)), H-NS (histone-like nucleoid structuring protein), HU (heat-unstable nucleoid protein), IciA (inhibitor of chromosome initiation A), IHF (integration host factor), Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein), and StpA (suppressor of td(-) phenotype A). The sequence specificity of DNA binding was determined for all the purified nucleoid proteins using gel-mobility shift assays. Five proteins (CbpB, DnaA, Fis, IHF, and Lrp) were found to bind to specific DNA sequences, while the remaining seven proteins (CbpA, Dps, Hfq, H-NS, HU, IciA, and StpA) showed apparently sequence-nonspecific DNA binding activities. Four proteins, CbpA, Hfq, H-NS, and IciA, showed the binding preference for the curved DNA. From the apparent dissociation constant (K(d)) determined using the sequence-specific or nonspecific DNA probes, the order of DNA binding affinity were determined to be: HU > IHF > Lrp > CbpB(Rob) > Fis > H-NS > StpA > CbpA > IciA > Hfq/Dps, ranging from 25 nM (HU binding to the non-curved DNA) to 250 nM (Hfq binding to the non-curved DNA), under the assay conditions employed.
