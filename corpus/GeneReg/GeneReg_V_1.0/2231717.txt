Characterization of the Escherichia coli araFGH and araJ promoters. The identities of two cloned, arabinose-inducible promoters were tested by hybridizing promoter DNA fragments with restriction digests of chromosomal DNA containing Mudlac phage inserted in either araFGH or in araE transport operons. One promoter, thought to be araE, is within 10(3) base-pairs of a Mudlac insertion in the araE gene. The second promoter was not found within several thousand base-pairs of either of the known transport genes. This promoter is now named araPJ (araJ). The DNA sequence of the fragment containing the araFGH promoter was determined. The start site of transcription in vivo was located to within +/- 1 base-pair (bp) by S1 nuclease mapping. DNase 1 footprinting revealed that, in comparison with the araBAD and araE promoters, the locations of the AraC and cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) binding sites are reversed with CRP lying between AraC and RNA polymerase. The central location of the CRP binding site may explain why the araFGH promoter is more catabolite sensitive than the other ara promoters. AraC and CRP were both required for maximal transcription in vitro, although a low level of transcription was detected with CRP alone. S1 nuclease mapping of mRNA-DNA hybrids from the araJ promoter located the transcription start point to within #/- 3 bp, and demonstrates that the promoter is dependent upon AraC protein and CRP in vivo. DNase footprinting showed that the location of the AraC protein binding site on araJ is adjacent to the RNA polymerase site, as seen at the araBAD and araE promoters. Two CRP sites were observed; one is upstream from the AraC site and one is downstream from the transcription start site.
