Cloning and sequence of the mdh structural gene of Escherichia coli coding for malate dehydrogenase. The malate dehydrogenase gene of Escherichia coli, which is susceptible to catabolite and anaerobic repression, has been cloned using plasmic pLC32-38 of Clarke and Carbon (1976). The nucleotide sequence was determined of a 2.47 kbp fragment, containing the mdh structural gene. All information necessary for expression of the mdh structural gene was mapped within a 1.3 kbp SphI-BstEII fragment. Compared with the untransformed wild type, transformations with pUC19 vector, containing this fragment, gave up to 40-fold more malate dehydrogenase activity in both E. coli wild type and mdh mutant recipients. Catabolite repression was not affected in the transformants. A possible CRP binding site in the promotor region of the mdh gene provides evidence for a co-regulation with fumA gene, the structural gene of fumarase, which is also subject to catabolite repression. The structures for transcription initiation and termination were similar to those previously described for E. coli. Amino acid sequence homologies between pro- and eucaryotic malate dehydrogenases are discussed.
