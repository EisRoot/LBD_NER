Signal transduction cascade between EvgA/EvgS and PhoP/PhoQ two-component systems of Escherichia coli. Transcriptional analysis of a constitutively active mutant of the EvgA/EvgS two-component system of Escherichia coli resulted in enhanced expression of 13 PhoP/PhoQ-regulated genes, crcA, hemL, mgtA, ompT, phoP, phoQ, proP, rstA, rstB, slyB, ybjG, yrbL, and mgrB. This regulatory network between the two systems also occurred as a result of overproduction of the EvgA regulator; however, enhanced transcription of the phoPQ genes did not further activate expression of the PhoP/PhoQ-regulated genes. These results demonstrated signal transduction from the EvgA/EvgS system to the PhoP/PhoQ system in E. coli and also identified the genes that required the two systems for enhanced expression. This is one example of the intricate signal transduction networks that are posited to exist in E. coli.
