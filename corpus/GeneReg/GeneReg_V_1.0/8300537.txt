The mannitol repressor (MtlR) of Escherichia coli. The mannitol operon of Escherichia coli, encoding the mannitol-specific enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system (Mt1A) and mannitol phosphate dehydrogenase (Mt1D), is here shown to contain a single additional downstream open reading frame which encodes the mannitol repressor (MtlR). Mt1R contains 195 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 21,990 and a calculated pI of 4.5. It is homologous to the product of an open reading frame (URF2D) upstream of the E. coli gapB gene but represents a novel type of transcriptional regulatory protein.
