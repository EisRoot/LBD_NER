Structure and transcriptional control of the flagellar master operon of Salmonella typhimurium. The flhD and flhC genes constitute the flagellar master operon whose products are required for expression of all the remaining flagellar operons in Salmonella typhimurium. Here we report the molecular structure and in vivo and in vitro expression of the flhD operon. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the upstream region of this operon contains the consensus sequence for the cAMP-CRP binding site. Primer extension analysis demonstrated six possible transcription start sites for this operon. They include CRP-dependent and CRP-repressible transcription start sites. The CRP-dependent transcription start site is located 203 bp upstream of the initiation codon of the flhD gene and preceded by the consensus sequences of the -10 and -35 regions of the sigma 70-dependent promoter. The putative cAMP-CRP binding site is located centered 70 bp upstream of this start site. The CRP-repressible transcription start site is located within this putative cAMP-CRP binding site. These two start sites were confirmed by in vitro transcription experiments using sigma 70-RNA polymerase with or without cAMP-CRP.
