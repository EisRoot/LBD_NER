Interplay of global regulators and cell physiology in the general stress response of Escherichia coli. Under various stress conditions, two sigma subunits of RNA polymerase, sigmaS and sigma70, coexist in Escherichia coli cells. In contrast to sigma70, sigmaS is subject to intricate regulation and coordinates an emergency reaction to stress as well as long term stress adaptation. In vivo, the two sigma factors clearly control different genes. Yet, they are structurally and functionally very similar and basically recognize the same promoter sequences. Recent data suggest that sigma factor specificity at stress-activated promoters is affected by the interplay of the two RNA polymeraseholoenzymes with additional regulatory factors, such as H-NS, Lrp, CRP, IHF or Fis, that differentially affect transcription initiation by sigmaS or sigma70 in a promoter-specific manner.
