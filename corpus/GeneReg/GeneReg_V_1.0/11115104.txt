Transcriptional regulation of transport and utilization systems for hexuronides, hexuronates and hexonates in gamma purple bacteria. The comparative approach is a powerful tool for the analysis of gene regulation in bacterial genomes. It can be applied to the analysis of regulons that have been studied experimentally as well as that of regulons for which no known regulatory sites are available. It is assumed that the set of co-regulated genes and the regulatory signal itself are conserved in related genomes. Here, we use genomic comparisons to study the regulation of transport and utilization systems for sugar acids in gamma purple bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia pestis, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae. The variability of the operon structure and the location of the operator sites for the main transcription factors are demonstrated. The common metabolic map is combined with known and predicted regulatory interactions. It includes all known and predicted members of the GntR, UxuR/ExuR, KdgR, UidR and IdnR regulons. Moreover, most members of these regulons seem to be under catabolite repression mediated by CRP. The candidate UxuR/ExuR signal is proposed, the KdgR consensus is extended, and new operators for all transcription factors are identified in all studied genomes. Two new members of the KdgR regulon, a hypothetical ATP-dependent transport system OgtABCD and YjgK protein with unknown function, are detected. The former is likely to be the transport system for the products of pectin degradation, oligogalacturonides.
