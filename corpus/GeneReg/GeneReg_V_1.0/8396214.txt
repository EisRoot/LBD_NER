The E. coli envY gene encodes a high affinity opioid binding site. In an attempt to isolate a cDNA encoding an opioid receptor, a cDNA library was constructed in the lambda ZAP vector using NG108-15 mRNA as template. Using an in vitro transcription-translation assay and a sib selection strategy, a single phage was isolated. An RNA transcribed from this cDNA was able to direct in vitro translation of opioid binding sites. The insert was sequenced and comparison with data banks showed a 100% homology with the E. coli envY gene. We assume that the presence of the envY sequence in the NG108-15 cDNA library was due to a contamination of the lambda ZAP vector with E. coli DNA. A search for opioid binding sites on E. coli strains showed that envY+ strains, but not envY- mutants were able to bind opiates. On envY+ cells, the sites are stereospecific, saturable and of high affinity for the opiate ligands. These sites bind opiate agonists and antagonists but neither mu nor delta opioid peptides. In contrast, rabbit reticulocyte lysate primed with RNA transcribed in vitro from the envY sequence elicited the synthesis of an opioid binding site with mixed mu and delta properties. In addition, transfection of the envY sequence into mammalian cells resulted in the expression of opioid binding sites. Depending on the type of cells transfected, these sites were selective for either the mu or delta ligands.
