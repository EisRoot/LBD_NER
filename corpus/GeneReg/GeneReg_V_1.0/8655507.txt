Cloning and molecular genetic characterization of the Escherichia coli gntR, gntK, and gntU genes of GntI, the main system for gluconate metabolism. Three genes involved in gluconate metabolism, gntR, gntK, and gntU, which code for a regulatory protein, a gluconate kinase, and a gluconate transporter, respectively, were cloned from Escherichia coli K-12 on the basis of their known locations on the genomic restriction map. The gene order is gntU, gntK, and gntR, which are immediately adjacent to asd at 77.0 min, and all three genes are transcribed in the counterclockwise direction. The gntR product is 331 amino acids long, with a helix-turn-helix motif typical of a regulatory protein. The gntK gene encodes a 175-amino-acid polypeptide that has an ATP-binding motif similar to those found in other sugar kinases. While GntK does not show significant sequence similarity to any known sugar kinases, it is 45% identical to a second putative gluconate kinase from E. coli,gntV. The 445-amino-acid sequence encoded by gntU has a secondary structure typical of membrane-spanning transport proteins and is 37% identical to the gntP product from Bacillus subtilis. Kinetic analysis of GntU indicates an apparent Km for gluconate of 212 microM, indicating that this is a low-affinity transporter. Studies demonstrate that the gntR gene is monocistronic, while the gntU and gntK genes, which are separated by only 3 bp, form an operon. Expression of gntR is essentially constitutive, while expression of gntKU is induced by gluconate and is subject to fourfold glucose catabolite repression. These results confirm that gntK and gntU, together with another gluconate transport gene, gntT, constitute the GntI system for gluconate utilization, under control of the gntR gene product, which is also responsible for induction of the edd and eda genes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway.
