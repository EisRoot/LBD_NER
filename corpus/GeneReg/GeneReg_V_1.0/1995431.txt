Overproduction and characterization of the iclR gene product of Escherichia coli K-12 and comparison with that of Salmonella typhimurium LT2. The iclR gene of Escherichia coli K-12, which encodes a regulatory protein (repressor) for the aceBAK operon, is located between that operon and metH in the 91-min region of the chromosome. The iclR gene was cloned and expressed in a coupled T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system and the gene product was identified by specific binding to a fragment containing the aceBAK operator region. The iclR gene product is a polypeptide of 274 amino acids (aa) with a calculated Mr of 29,741. Comparison of the deduced IclR aa sequence to that of Salmonella typhimurium revealed that the two IclR repressors exhibit 89% identity. A possible helix-turn-helix motif characteristic of DNA-binding proteins was found within the IclR sequence. A search in protein data banks revealed that IclR has a score of similarity of 43.7% with GylR, a transcriptional regulator of the glycerol operon of Streptomyces coelicolor.
